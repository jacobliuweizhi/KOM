  - Etiology: primary contributing factors: <CONTRIBUTING_FACTORS>

- Evidence base `${documents}`: anonymized OA nutrition and psychological intervention guidelines

Task  
Generate a personalized intervention plan for both nutrition and psychology. Let the model determine the appropriate total duration for each intervention based on patient etiology and needs. If a multi-phase structure is warranted, subdivide into phases with their own durations.
