KOM
Knee Osteoarthritis Management
Comprehensive KOA Precision Care System

🔍 Background
Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) affects an estimated 600 million people worldwide, leading to chronic pain, progressive functional decline, and, in severe cases, the need for knee replacement surgery. Early and individualized intervention is critical to slow disease progression, yet scaling multidisciplinary KOA care remains constrained by healthcare capacity and coordination challenges.

🚀 Opportunities
Recent advances in medical technology enable:

Automated imaging interpretation

Individualized risk prediction

Tailored treatment planning

However, most existing solutions address only isolated stages of care. A fully integrated approach that supports the complete clinical pathway is still rare, and end-to-end implementation continues to require substantial resources.

🌟 System Overview
Building on prior clinical research and practice in osteoarthritis management, we have developed capabilities including:

Structured clinical data processing and task coordination

Guideline-compliant treatment recommendation generation

Simulated multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration

These are combined in KOM:

The first system to deliver end-to-end KOA precision management — from comprehensive evaluation to personalized treatment planning — with standardized, streamlined processes.

🏗️ System Components
KOM consists of three core modules working in coordination through advanced analytical models and rule-based decision engines:

Assessment Module

Processes multimodal patient data

Conducts structured patient interactions

Analyzes radiological images

Generates complete clinical evaluation reports

Risk Prediction Module

Estimates individual disease progression risk

Identifies patient-specific risk factors

Produces detailed risk assessment results

Treatment Planning Module

Simulates MDT discussions

Utilizes independent, evidence-based medical knowledge bases

Develops individualized management plans based on assessment and risk results
