Knee Osteoarthritis Management
KOA Precision Management Multi-Agent System
KOA affects ~600M people globally, causing progressive pain and functional deterioration often leading to knee replacement. While timely personalized intervention is crucial, delivering multidisciplinary KOA management at scale exceeds current healthcare capacity.

Recent AI advances have created opportunities for precise KOA management through automated imaging analysis, risk prediction, and treatment planning. However, existing studies typically address isolated treatment stages rather than supporting the complete clinical pathway, and comprehensive implementation remains resource-intensive.

Building on our previous work in structured prompt engineering for LLMs in osteoarthritis care, RAG-enhanced guideline-compliant treatment recommendations, and multi-agent MDT simulation, we present KOM - the first end-to-end multi-agent system for KOA precision management that automates the entire evaluation and treatment process.

System Components
KOM integrates LLMs, ResNet architecture, and ML algorithms through three specialized agents:

Assessment Agent: Processes multimodal data, engages with patients, analyzes radiological images, and produces comprehensive evaluation reports.

Risk Agent: Forecasts individual KOA progression risk, identifies specific high-risk factors, and generates detailed risk assessment reports.

Treatment Multi-Agent Cluster: Simulates MDT discussions using agents with independent evidence-based medical databases to craft personalized management plans based on patient assessments and risk reports.
