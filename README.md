# **KOM: Knee Osteoarthritis Management**

### **A Multi-Agent Artificial Intelligence System for Precision KOA Care**

---

## 🌍 Background

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) affects more than **600 million people worldwide**, leading to chronic pain, functional decline, and increased healthcare burden. Although clinical guidelines emphasize **personalized** and **multidisciplinary** management, real-world practice often falls short due to:

* Limited clinical resources and time
* High variability in patient presentations
* Lack of standardized assessment workflows
* Existing tools addressing only isolated tasks (e.g., imaging or prediction)

To address these unmet needs, we developed **KOM**, a multi-agent AI system designed to support the **entire clinical workflow** of KOA management.

---

## 🚀 What is KOM?

**KOM is the first end-to-end AI system designed to support structured assessment, risk identification, and personalized treatment planning for KOA.**

It integrates **large language models (LLMs)** with **small, interpretable machine learning models**, coordinated through a **modular multi-agent architecture**, enabling transparent, clinically grounded decision-making.

## 🔧 Key Capabilities

### **1️⃣ Structured Assessment & Information Extraction**

* Interactive history-taking
* Automated radiographic evaluation (X-ray)
* Extraction and quantification of KOA-specific risk factors
* Standardized clinical summaries

### **2️⃣ Symptomatic & Structural Progression Prediction**

* Parallel short- and mid-term progression prediction
* Hybrid modeling combining stable DL models with LLM reasoning
* Explainability via feature analysis and visual interpretability tools

### **3️⃣ Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) Decision Support**

KOM simulates a virtual multidisciplinary panel composed of role-specific AI agents:

* Sports medicine specialist agent
* Radiologist agent
* Rehabilitation & exercise therapy agent
* Pharmacologic & Surgery agent

Through coordinated collaboration, the system produces **personalized, guideline-informed treatment plans**.

These are combined in **KOM**:

> **The first system to deliver end-to-end KOA precision management — from comprehensive evaluation to personalized treatment planning — with standardized, streamlined processes.**

## 🏗️ System Components

KOM consists of three core modules working in coordination through advanced analytical models and rule-based decision engines:

### 1. Assessment Module
- Processes multimodal patient data
- Conducts structured patient interactions
- Analyzes radiological images
- Generates complete clinical evaluation reports

### 2. Risk Prediction Module
- Estimates individual disease progression risk
- Identifies patient-specific risk factors
- Produces detailed risk assessment results

### 3. Treatment Planning Module
- Simulates MDT discussions
- Utilizes independent, evidence-based medical knowledge bases
- Develops individualized management plans based on assessment and risk results

## 🧠 Technical Highlights

### **🔹 Modular Multi-Agent Architecture**

KOM decomposes the KOA workflow into verifiable, domain-specific modules:
**Assessment → Risk Identification → Personalized Therapy**

Each agent contributes expertise, producing more interpretable and stable outputs than monolithic LLMs.

### **🔹 Hybrid LLM–DL Framework**

* **LLMs**: complex reasoning, synthesis, and clinical logic
* **Small models**: robust predictions, consistent performance, transparency

This synergy improves decision quality in imaging interpretation, risk prediction, and treatment planning.

### **🔹 Clinical Simulation Study**

In controlled simulated evaluations:

* **Clinicians using KOM completed consultations 38.5% faster**
* Their outputs received **higher expert ratings** across multiple domains

These results indicate KOM’s potential to improve efficiency and consistency in high-volume outpatient settings.
