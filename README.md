**Knee Osteoarthritis Management**  
*KOA Precision Management Multi-Agent System*

---

## 🔍 Background

KOA affects approximately 600 million people worldwide, causing progressive pain and functional decline that often leads to knee replacement. While personalized, timely intervention is critical, scaling multidisciplinary KOA management exceeds the capacity of current healthcare systems.

## 🚀 Opportunities

Recent advances in AI enable:  
- **Automated imaging analysis**  
- **Risk prediction**  
- **Precision treatment planning**  

However, most studies focus on isolated stages of care rather than supporting the full clinical pathway, and end-to-end implementation remains resource-intensive.

## 🌟 Introduction

Building on our prior work in osteoarthritis care:  
1. Structured prompt engineering for LLMs  
2. RAG-enhanced, guideline-compliant treatment recommendations  
3. Multi-agent MDT (multidisciplinary team) simulation  

We introduce **KOM**:  
> **The first end-to-end multi-agent system for KOA precision management, automating the entire evaluation and treatment process.**

## 🏗️ System Components

KOM integrates LLMs, ResNet architectures, and machine learning algorithms via three specialized agents:

1. **Assessment Agent**  
   - Processes multimodal data  
   - Interacts with patients  
   - Analyzes radiological images  
   - Generates comprehensive evaluation reports  

2. **Risk Agent**  
   - Forecasts individual KOA progression risk  
   - Identifies specific high-risk factors  
   - Produces detailed risk assessment reports  

3. **Treatment Multi-Agent Cluster**  
   - Simulates MDT discussions using agents backed by independent evidence-based medical databases  
   - Crafts personalized management plans based on assessment and risk reports
